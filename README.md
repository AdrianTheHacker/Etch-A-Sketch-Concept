# Etchasketch Concept
This project is designed to be a concept of what an etchasketch could be. It'll allow for modern features that aid artist ability, and truly allow them to *Draw the Future*.

## Requirements
In no particular order, the requirements are as follows:
1. Display has at least 3 colours (white counts as a colour).
2. Display can update at least once per second.
3. Users can control the drawing cursor of the display using rotary inputs which read input a minimum of every 10ms*.
4. The product should be at most 77mm by 100mm by 40mm.
5. Users can save the current drawing on the display on a laptop.
6. Different devices can share a given drawing session to collaborate on designs.

*Note that the rate in which an input is processed is independent of the rate in which the screen will be updating.
